Also, males use bikes far more than females. Third, subscribers always use bikes during their commute, and customers usually use them for weekend pleasure. So we can provide enough bike supply on popular start place at weekday and more on leisure places during the weekend based on specific city situation. 


Two additional visualizations are suggested for future analysis (Please see the images and descriptions above):

The company can provide more bikes on these top starting locations to avoid the supply shortage, especially for the busy working hours.
